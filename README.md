# Opensource_Sentinel2_download_processing_chain
Automization of Sentinel-2 data download and pre-processing, and adaptation of a semi-automatized image processing chain to Sentinel 2 data.

You will find on this repository two consecutive scripts:
- one which allows you to download Sentinel-2 data from the Copernicus Hub and to pre-process the images
- the other, an adaptation of a Very High Resolution processing chain, which will process the resulting image of the first step (high resolution data).
